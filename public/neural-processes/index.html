<p>On Tuesday <span class="math inline">\(14^{\text{th}}\)</span> of July, Mingxuan presented <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01622.pdf">Neural Processes</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01613.pdf">Conditional Neural Processes</a> by Marta Garnelo et al.</p>
<p>Abstract for Neural Processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A neural network (NN) is a parameterised function that can be tuned via gradient descent to approximate a labelled collection of data with high
precision. A Gaussian process (GP), on the other
hand, is a probabilistic model that defines a distribution over possible functions, and is updated
in light of data via the rules of probabilistic inference. GPs are probabilistic, data-efficient and
flexible, however they are also computationally intensive and thus limited in their applicability. We
introduce a class of neural latent variable models
which we call Neural Processes (NPs), combining the best of both worlds. Like GPs, NPs define
distributions over functions, are capable of rapid
adaptation to new observations, and can estimate
the uncertainty in their predictions. Like NNs,
NPs are computationally efficient during training
and evaluation but also learn to adapt their priors
to data. We demonstrate the performance of NPs
on a range of learning tasks, including regression
and optimisation, and compare and contrast with
related models in the literature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abstract for Conditional Neural Processes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deep neural networks excel at function approximation, yet they are typically trained from scratch
for each new function. On the other hand,
Bayesian methods, such as Gaussian Processes
(GPs), exploit prior knowledge to quickly infer
the shape of a new function at test time. Yet GPs
are computationally expensive, and it can be hard
to design appropriate priors. In this paper we
propose a family of neural models, Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs), that combine the benefits of both. CNPs are inspired by the flexibility
of stochastic processes such as GPs, but are structured as neural networks and trained via gradient
descent. CNPs make accurate predictions after
observing only a handful of training data points,
yet scale to complex functions and large datasets.
We demonstrate the performance and versatility
of the approach on a range of canonical machine
learning tasks, including regression, classification
and image completion.</p>
