      <description>On Monday \(2^{\text{nd}}\) of November, Song presented Likelihood-free MCMC with Amortized Approximate Ratio Estimators. The abstract is given below:
 Posterior inference with an intractable likelihood is becoming an increasingly common task in scientific domains which rely on sophisticated computer simulations. Typically, these forward models do not admit tractable densities forcing practitioners to make use of approximations. This work introduces a novel approach to address the intractability of the likelihood and the marginal model.</description>
