      <description>On Wednesday the \(7^{\text{th}}\) of April, Anthony presented A Shooting Formulation of Deep Learning. This is closely related to Neural ODEs and Augmented Neural ODEs. The abstract is given below:
 A residual network may be regarded as a discretization of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) which, in the limit of time discretization, defines a continuous-depth network. Although important steps have been taken to realize the advantages of such continuous formulations, most current techniques assume identical layers.</description>
