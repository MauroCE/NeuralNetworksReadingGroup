      <description>On Wednesday the \(14^{\text{th}}\) of April Chang presented The Thermodynamic Variational Objective. The abstract is given below.
 We introduce the thermodynamic variational objective (TVO) for learning in both continuous and discrete deep generative models. The TVO arises from a key connection between variational inference and thermodynamic integration that results in a tighter lower bound to the log marginal likelihood than the standard variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) while remaining as broadly applicable.</description>
