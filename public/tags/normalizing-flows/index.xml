      <description>On Tuesday \(28^{\text{th}}\) of July, Mauro presented Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows by Rezende and Mohamed. Two good review papers are Normalizing Flows for Probabilistic Modeling and Inference, which is more Tutorial in nature, and Normalizing Flows: An Introduction and Review of Current Methods, which is a bit more technical. Slides for the talk are available here.
The abstract is given below:
 The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems in variational inference.</description>
