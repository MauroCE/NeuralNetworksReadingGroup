      <description>On Tuesday \(28^{\text{th}}\) of July, Mauro presented Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows by Rezende and Mohamed. Two good review papers are Normalizing Flows for Probabilistic Modeling and Inference, which is more Tutorial in nature, and Normalizing Flows: An Introduction and Review of Current Methods, which is a bit more technical. Slides for the talk are available here.
The abstract is given below:
 The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems in variational inference.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 2nd of June Christophe Andrieu presented MetFlow: A New Efficient Method for Bridging the Gap between Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference. A related presentation was given by Andy Wang on Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference: Bridging the Gap. The abstract is given below:
 In this contribution, we propose a new computationally efficient method to combine Variational Inference (VI) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(28^{\text{th}}\) of April Andi Wang presented Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference: Bridging the Gap - Tim Salimans. His slides are available here and the abstract is given below.
 Recent advances in stochastic gradient variational inference have made it possible to perform variational Bayesian inference with posterior approximations containing auxiliary random variables. This enables us to explore a new synthesis of variational inference and Monte Carlo methods where we incorporate one or more steps of MCMC into our variational approximation.</description>
