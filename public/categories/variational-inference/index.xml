      <description>On Tuesday \(14^{\text{th}}\) of July, Mingxuan presented Neural Processes and Conditional Neural Processes by Marta Garnelo et al.
Abstract for Neural Processes:
 A neural network (NN) is a parameterised function that can be tuned via gradient descent to approximate a labelled collection of data with high precision. A Gaussian process (GP), on the other hand, is a probabilistic model that defines a distribution over possible functions, and is updated in light of data via the rules of probabilistic inference.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(7^{\text{th}}\) of July, Mauro Camara Escudero presented Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes. Slides can be found here. The abstract is given below.
 How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case.</description>

      <description>On Thursday \(25^{\text{th}}\) of June Song Liu presented Stein Variational Gradient Descent as Gradient Flow. The abstract is given below.
 Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a deterministic sampling algorithm that iteratively transports a set of particles to approximate given distributions, based on a gradient-based update that guarantees to optimally decrease the KL divergence within a function space. This paper develops the first theoretical analysis on SVGD. We establish that the empirical measures of the SVGD samples weakly converge to the target distribution, and show that the asymptotic behavior of SVGD is characterized by a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation known as Vlasov equation in physics.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 2nd of June Christophe Andrieu presented MetFlow: A New Efficient Method for Bridging the Gap between Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference. A related presentation was given by Andy Wang on Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference: Bridging the Gap. The abstract is given below:
 In this contribution, we propose a new computationally efficient method to combine Variational Inference (VI) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 26th of May Pierre Aurelien Gilliot presented Preventing Posterior Collapse with delta-VAEs. The main reference paper was the original VAE paper. The abstract is given below.
 Due to the phenomenon of “posterior collapse,” current latent variable generative models pose a challenging design choice that either weakens the capacity of the decoder or requires augmenting the objective so it does not only maximize the likelihood of the data.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(28^{\text{th}}\) of April Andi Wang presented Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference: Bridging the Gap - Tim Salimans. His slides are available here and the abstract is given below.
 Recent advances in stochastic gradient variational inference have made it possible to perform variational Bayesian inference with posterior approximations containing auxiliary random variables. This enables us to explore a new synthesis of variational inference and Monte Carlo methods where we incorporate one or more steps of MCMC into our variational approximation.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(14^{\text{th}}\) of April I presented Expectation Backpropagation:Parameter-Free Training of Multilayer Neural Networks with Continuous or Discrete Weights. The abstract is given below.
 Multilayer Neural Networks (MNNs) are commonly trained using gradient descent-based methods, such as BackPropagation (BP). Inference in probabilistic graphical models is often done using variational Bayes methods, such as Expectation Propagation (EP). We show how an EP based approach can also be used to train deterministic MNNs.</description>
