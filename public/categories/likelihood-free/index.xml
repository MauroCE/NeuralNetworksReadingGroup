      <description>On Wednesday the \(31^{\text{th}}\) of March, Mark presented Sequential Neural Posterior and Likelihood Approximation. The abstract is given below:
 We introduce the sequential neural posterior and likelihood approximation (SNPLA) algorithm. SNPLA is a normalizing flows-based algorithm for inference in implicit models. Thus, SNPLA is a simulation-based inference method that only requires simulations from a generative model. Compared to similar methods, the main advantage of SNPLA is that our method jointly learns both the posterior and the likelihood.</description>

      <description>On Monday \(2^{\text{nd}}\) of November, Song presented Likelihood-free MCMC with Amortized Approximate Ratio Estimators. The abstract is given below:
 Posterior inference with an intractable likelihood is becoming an increasingly common task in scientific domains which rely on sophisticated computer simulations. Typically, these forward models do not admit tractable densities forcing practitioners to make use of approximations. This work introduces a novel approach to address the intractability of the likelihood and the marginal model.</description>

      <description>On Monday the 19th of October 2020 Chang Zhang presented Learning in Implicit Generative Models by Shakir Mohamed and Balaji Lakshminarayanan. The abstract is given below.
 Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an algorithmic framework for constructing generative models with several appealing properties: they do not require a likelihood function to be specified, only a generating procedure; they provide samples that are sharp and compelling; and they allow us to harness our knowledge of building highly accurate neural network classifiers.</description>
