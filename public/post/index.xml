      <description>On Wednesday the \(30^{\text{th}}\) of June, Dan presented A Likelihood-Free Inference Framework for Population Genetic Data using Exchangeable Neural Networks. The abstract is below.
 An explosion of high-throughput DNA sequencing in the past decade has led to a surge of interest in population-scale inference with whole-genome data. Recent work in population genetics has centered on designing inference methods for relatively simple model classes, and few scalable general-purpose inference techniques exist for more realistic, complex models.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday the \(23^{rd}\) of June Sam presented Deep Gaussian Processes. The abstract is given below.
 In this paper we introduce deep Gaussian process (GP) models. Deep GPs are a deep belief network based on Gaussian process mappings. The data is modeled as the output of a multivariate GP. The inputs to that Gaussian process are then governed by another GP. A single layer model is equivalent to a standard GP or the GP latent variable model (GP-LVM).</description>

      <description>On Wednesday the \(9^{\text{th}}\) of June, Henry presented Test-Time Training with Self-Supervision for Generalization under Distribution Shifts. The abstract is given below:
 In this paper, we propose Test-Time Training, a general approach for improving the performance of predictive models when training and test data come from different distributions. We turn a single unlabeled test sample into a self-supervised learning problem, on which we update the model parameters before making a prediction.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday the \(12^{\text{th}}\) presented Hopfield Networks is All You Need. A useful blog post and video can be found here and here respectively. The abstract is given below.
 We introduce a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and a corresponding update rule. The new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors.</description>

      <description>On Thusrday the \(6^{\text{th}}\) of May Mingxuan presented Generalized Sliced Wasserstein Distances. The abstract is given below:
 The Wasserstein distance and its variations, e.g., the sliced-Wasserstein (SW) distance, have recently drawn attention from the machine learning community. The SW distance, specifically, was shown to have similar properties to the Wasserstein distance, while being much simpler to compute, and is therefore used in various applications including generative modeling and general supervised/unsupervised learning.</description>

      <description>On Thursday the \(29^{\text{th}}\) of April, Mauro presented Differentiable Particle Filtering via Entropy-Regularized Optimal Transport by Corenflos et al.Â You can find the abstract below.
 Particle Filtering (PF) methods are an established class of procedures for performing inference in non-linear state-space models. Resampling is a key ingredient of PF, necessary to obtain low variance likelihood and states estimates. However, traditional resampling methods result in PF-based loss functions being non-differentiable with respect to model and PF parameters.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday the \(21^{\text{st}}\) of April Song presented Telescoping Density-Ratio Estimation.
 Density-ratio estimation via classification is a cornerstone of unsupervised learning. It has provided the foundation for state-of-the-art methods in representation learning and generative modelling, with the number of use-cases continuing to proliferate. However, it suffers from a critical limitation: it fails to accurately estimate ratios p/q for which the two densities differ significantly. Empirically, we find this occurs whenever the KL divergence between p and q exceeds tens of nats.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday the \(14^{\text{th}}\) of April Chang presented The Thermodynamic Variational Objective. The abstract is given below.
 We introduce the thermodynamic variational objective (TVO) for learning in both continuous and discrete deep generative models. The TVO arises from a key connection between variational inference and thermodynamic integration that results in a tighter lower bound to the log marginal likelihood than the standard variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) while remaining as broadly applicable.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday the \(7^{\text{th}}\) of April, Anthony presented A Shooting Formulation of Deep Learning. This is closely related to Neural ODEs and Augmented Neural ODEs. The abstract is given below:
 A residual network may be regarded as a discretization of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) which, in the limit of time discretization, defines a continuous-depth network. Although important steps have been taken to realize the advantages of such continuous formulations, most current techniques assume identical layers.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday the \(31^{\text{th}}\) of March, Mark presented Sequential Neural Posterior and Likelihood Approximation. The abstract is given below:
 We introduce the sequential neural posterior and likelihood approximation (SNPLA) algorithm. SNPLA is a normalizing flows-based algorithm for inference in implicit models. Thus, SNPLA is a simulation-based inference method that only requires simulations from a generative model. Compared to similar methods, the main advantage of SNPLA is that our method jointly learns both the posterior and the likelihood.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday the \(3^{\text{th}}\) of March Henry presented NeuralFDR: Learning Discovery Thresholds from Hypothesis Features by Xia et al.Â The abstract is given below.
 As datasets grow richer, an important challenge is to leverage the full features in the data to maximize the number of useful discoveries while controlling for false positives. We address this problem in the context of multiple hypotheses testing, where for each hypothesis, we observe a p-value along with a set of features specific to that hypothesis.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday teh \(24^{\text{th}}\) of February Sam presented How to train your energy-based models by Yang Song and Diederik P. Kingma. You can find his presentation here and the abstract below.
 Energy-Based Models (EBMs), also known as non-normalized probabilistic models, specify probability density or mass functions up to an unknown normalizing constant. Unlike most other probabilistic models, EBMs do not place a restriction on the tractability of the normalizing constant, thus are more flexible to parameterize and can model a more expressive family of probability distributions.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday \(3^{\text{th}}\) of February Sam Tickle presented Deep learning of contagion dynamics on complex networks. The slides are available here and the abstract is given below.
 Forecasting the evolution of contagion dynamics is still an open problem to which mechanistic models only offer a partial answer. To remain mathematically or computationally tractable, these models must rely on simplifying assumptions, thereby limiting the quantitative accuracy of their predictions and the complexity of the dynamics they can model.</description>

      <description>On Monday \(14^{\text{th}}\) of December Anthony presented Stochastic Normalizing Flows. The abstract is given below:
 The sampling of probability distributions specified up to a normalization constant is an important problem in both machine learning and statistical mechanics. While classical stochastic sampling methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Langevin Dynamics (LD) can suffer from slow mixing times there is a growing interest in using normalizing flows in order to learn the transformation of a simple prior distribution to the given target distribution.</description>

      <description>On Monday \(7^{\text{th}}\) of December Andi presented Toward a theory of optimization for over-parameterized systems of non-linear equations: the lessons of deep learning. The abstract is given below:
 The success of deep learning is due, to a great extent, to the remarkable effectiveness of gradient-based optimization methods applied to large neural networks. In this work we isolate some general mathematical structures allowing for efficient optimization in over-parameterized systems of non-linear equations, a setting that includes deep neural networks.</description>

      <description>On Monday the \(30^{\text{th}}\) of Novembre, Christophe presented Estimation under invariant distributions by Yamato et al.Â The abstract is given below:
 If a distribution is invariant under a finite group of transformations, an estimator of a parameter associated with the distribution is improved by making it invariant. The resulting invariant estimator is characterized as the projection of the original estimator. If the estimator is the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator of its expectation for continuous distributions, then the invariant estimator is the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator for invariant and continuous distributions.</description>

 At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit (16; 4; 7; 13; 6), thus connecting them to kernel methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function fÎ¸ (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in contrast to the parameter cost) w.</description>

      <description>On Monday \(16^{\text{th}}\) of November Mark presented Analyzing Inverse Problems with Invertible Neural Networks. You can find the abstract below:
 For many applications, in particular in natural science, the task is to determine hidden system parameters from a set of measurements. Often, the forward process from parameter- to measurement-space is well-defined, whereas the inverse problem is ambiguous: multiple parameter sets can result in the same measurement. To fully characterize this ambiguity, the full posterior parameter distribution, conditioned on an observed measurement, has to be determined.</description>

 Posterior inference with an intractable likelihood is becoming an increasingly common task in scientific domains which rely on sophisticated computer simulations. Typically, these forward models do not admit tractable densities forcing practitioners to make use of approximations. This work introduces a novel approach to address the intractability of the likelihood and the marginal model.</description>

Abstract for Neural Processes:
 A neural network (NN) is a parameterised function that can be tuned via gradient descent to approximate a labelled collection of data with high precision. A Gaussian process (GP), on the other hand, is a probabilistic model that defines a distribution over possible functions, and is updated in light of data via the rules of probabilistic inference.</description>

 Simulators often provide the best description of real-world phenomena. However, the probability density that they implicitly define is often intractable, leading to challenging inverse problems for inference. Recently, a number of techniques have been introduced in which a surrogate for the intractable density is learned, including normalizing flows and density ratio estimators.</description>

      <description>On Thursday \(25^{\text{th}}\) of June Song Liu presented Stein Variational Gradient Descent as Gradient Flow. The abstract is given below.
 Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a deterministic sampling algorithm that iteratively transports a set of particles to approximate given distributions, based on a gradient-based update that guarantees to optimally decrease the KL divergence within a function space. This paper develops the first theoretical analysis on SVGD. We establish that the empirical measures of the SVGD samples weakly converge to the target distribution, and show that the asymptotic behavior of SVGD is characterized by a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation known as Vlasov equation in physics.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(16^{\text{th}}\) of June Patrick Rubin-Delanchy presented Adaptive approximation and estimation of deep neural network to intrinsic dimensionality. The abstract is given below.
 We prove that the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) is mainly determined by an intrinsic low-dimensionality of covariates. DNNs have been providing an outstanding performance empirically, hence, the theoretical properties of DNNs are actively investigated to understand their mechanism. In particular, the behavior of DNNs with respect to high-dimensional data is one of the most important concerns.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 9th of June Anthony Lee presented From optimal transport to generative modeling: the VEGAN cookbook. The abstract is given below:
 We study unsupervised generative modeling in terms of the optimal transport (OT) problem between true (but unknown) data distribution PX and the latent variable model distribution PG. We show that the OT problem can be equivalently written in terms of probabilistic encoders, which are constrained to match the posterior and prior distributions over the latent space.</description>

      <description>On Tuesdayâs 5th of May Sam Tickle has presented Deep Learning for Multi-Scale Changepoint Detection in Multivariate Time Series. The abstract is given below.
 Many real-world time series, such as in health, have changepoints where the systemâs structure or parameters change. Since changepoints can indicate critical events such as onset of illness, it is highly important to detect them. However, existing methods for changepoint detection (CPD) often require user-specified models and cannot recognize changes that occur gradually or at multiple time-scales.</description>

 Recent advances in stochastic gradient variational inference have made it possible to perform variational Bayesian inference with posterior approximations containing auxiliary random variables. This enables us to explore a new synthesis of variational inference and Monte Carlo methods where we incorporate one or more steps of MCMC into our variational approximation.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(14^{\text{th}}\) of April I presented Expectation Backpropagation:Parameter-Free Training of Multilayer Neural Networks with Continuous or Discrete Weights. The abstract is given below.
 Multilayer Neural Networks (MNNs) are commonly trained using gradient descent-based methods, such as BackPropagation (BP). Inference in probabilistic graphical models is often done using variational Bayes methods, such as Expectation Propagation (EP). We show how an EP based approach can also be used to train deterministic MNNs.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 7\(^{\text{th}}\) of April Mark Beaumont presented Partially Exchangeable Networks and Architectures for Learning Summary Statistics in Approximate Bayesian Computation. The abstract is given below.
 We present a novel family of deep neural architectures, named partially exchangeable networks (PENs) that leverage probabilistic symmetries. By design, PENs are invariant to block-switch transformations, which characterize the partial exchangeability properties of conditionally Markovian processes. Moreover, we show that any block-switch invariant function has a PEN-like representation.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 24\(^{th}\) of March Song Liu presented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. The abstract is given below.
 We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed.</description>

 Aimed at explaining the surprisingly good generalization behavior of overparameterized deep networks, recent works have developed a variety of generalization bounds for deep learning, all based on the fundamental learning-theoretic technique of uniform convergence.</description>

 Consider the multivariate nonparametric regression model. It is shown that estimators based on sparsely connected deep neural networks with ReLU activation function and properly chosen network architecture achieve the minimax rates of convergence (up to logn-factors) under a general composition assumption on the regression function.</description>

The abstract is given below.
 We present a new learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines that contain many layers of hidden variables. Data-dependent expectations are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and dataindependent expectations are approximated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of expectation that enter into the gradient of the log-likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters.</description>
