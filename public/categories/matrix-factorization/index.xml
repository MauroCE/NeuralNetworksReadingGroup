      <description>On Wednesday the \(10^{\text{th}}\) of February Patrick presented Neural Word Embedding as Implicit Matrix Factorization by Levy and Goldberg. You can find some hand-written notes here. The abstract is given below.
 We analyze skip-gram with negative-sampling (SGNS), a word embedding method introduced by Mikolov et al., and show that it is implicitly factorizing a word-context matrix, whose cells are the pointwise mutual information (PMI) of the respective word and context pairs, shifted by a global constant.</description>
