      <description>On Wednesday the \(23^{rd}\) of June Sam presented Deep Gaussian Processes. The abstract is given below.
 In this paper we introduce deep Gaussian process (GP) models. Deep GPs are a deep belief network based on Gaussian process mappings. The data is modeled as the output of a multivariate GP. The inputs to that Gaussian process are then governed by another GP. A single layer model is equivalent to a standard GP or the GP latent variable model (GP-LVM).</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(14^{\text{th}}\) of July, Mingxuan presented Neural Processes and Conditional Neural Processes by Marta Garnelo et al.Â You can find the notes here.
Abstract for Neural Processes:
 A neural network (NN) is a parameterised function that can be tuned via gradient descent to approximate a labelled collection of data with high precision. A Gaussian process (GP), on the other hand, is a probabilistic model that defines a distribution over possible functions, and is updated in light of data via the rules of probabilistic inference.</description>
