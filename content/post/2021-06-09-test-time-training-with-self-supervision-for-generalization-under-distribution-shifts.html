<p>On Wednesday the <span class="math inline">\(9^{\text{th}}\)</span> of June, Henry presented <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/sun20b/sun20b.pdf">Test-Time Training with Self-Supervision
for Generalization under Distribution Shifts</a>. The abstract is given below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this paper, we propose Test-Time Training, a
general approach for improving the performance
of predictive models when training and test data
come from different distributions. We turn a single unlabeled test sample into a self-supervised
learning problem, on which we update the model
parameters before making a prediction. This also
extends naturally to data in an online stream. Our
simple approach leads to improvements on diverse image classification benchmarks aimed at
evaluating robustness to distribution shifts.</p>
