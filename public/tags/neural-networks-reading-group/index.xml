      <description>On Wednesday the \(7^{\text{th}}\) of April, Anthony presented A Shooting Formulation of Deep Learning. This is closely related to Neural ODEs and Augmented Neural ODEs. The abstract is given below:
 A residual network may be regarded as a discretization of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) which, in the limit of time discretization, defines a continuous-depth network. Although important steps have been taken to realize the advantages of such continuous formulations, most current techniques assume identical layers.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! I hope you are as excited as we are about the Neural Network reading group. We thought weâ€™d make it more engaging by having a simple website where we can share links to the papers, post summaries and ideas. This is still a work in progress and feeback and suggestions are very much appreciated. For now, you can send your feedback to m.camaraescudero@bristol.ac.uk or to ys18223@bristol.ac.uk.</description>
