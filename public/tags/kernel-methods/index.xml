      <description>On Monday \(23^{\text{rd}}\) of November Mingxuan presented Neural Tangent Kernel: Convergence and Generalization in Neural Networks. You can find the abstract below:
 At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit (16; 4; 7; 13; 6), thus connecting them to kernel methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function fÎ¸ (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in contrast to the parameter cost) w.</description>
