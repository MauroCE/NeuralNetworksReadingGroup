      <description>On Tuesday 17th of December Anthony Lee presented the paper Nonparametric regression using deep neural networks with ReLU activation function by Johannes Schmidt-Hieber. The abstract is given below.
 Consider the multivariate nonparametric regression model. It is shown that estimators based on sparsely connected deep neural networks with ReLU activation function and properly chosen network architecture achieve the minimax rates of convergence (up to logn-factors) under a general composition assumption on the regression function.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! I hope you are as excited as we are about this reading group. We thought we’d make it more engaging by having a simple website where we can share links to the papers, post summaries and ideas. This is still a work in progress and feeback and suggestions are very much appreciated. For now, you can send your feedback to m.camaraescudero@bristol.ac.uk or to ys18223@bristol.ac.uk.</description>
