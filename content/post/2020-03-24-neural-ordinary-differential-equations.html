<p>On Tuesday 24<span class="math inline">\(^{th}\)</span> of March Song Liu presented <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07366.pdf">Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</a>. The abstract is given below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a
discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden
state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant
memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade
numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth
residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct
continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum
likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we
show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its
internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.</p>
