      <description>On Tuesday 7\(^{\text{th}}\) of April Mark Beaumont presented Partially Exchangeable Networks and Architectures for Learning Summary Statistics in Approximate Bayesian Computation. The abstract is given below.
 We present a novel family of deep neural architectures, named partially exchangeable networks (PENs) that leverage probabilistic symmetries. By design, PENs are invariant to block-switch transformations, which characterize the partial exchangeability properties of conditionally Markovian processes. Moreover, we show that any block-switch invariant function has a PEN-like representation.</description>
