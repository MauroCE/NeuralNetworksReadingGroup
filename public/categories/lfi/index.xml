      <description>On Monday the 19th of October 2020 Chang Zhang presented Learning in Implicit Generative Models by Shakir Mohamed and Balaji Lakshminarayanan. The abstract is given below.
 Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an algorithmic framework for constructing generative models with several appealing properties: they do not require a likelihood function to be specified, only a generating procedure; they provide samples that are sharp and compelling; and they allow us to harness our knowledge of building highly accurate neural network classifiers.</description>
