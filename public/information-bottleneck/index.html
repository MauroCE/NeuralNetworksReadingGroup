<p>On Tuesday <span class="math inline">\(21^{\text{st}}\)</span> of April Mingxuan Yi talked about the topic of information bottleneck. The main references used were <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00810.pdf">Opening the black box of Deep Neural Networks via Information</a> by Ravid Schwartz-Ziv and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02406.pdf">Deep Learning and the Information Bottleneck Principle</a>. The abstracts are given below</p>
<p><strong>Opening the black box of Deep Neural Networks via Information</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite their great success, there is still no comprehensive theoretical understanding of learning
with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or their inner organization. Previous work [Tishby and Zaslavsky (2015)] proposed to analyze DNNs in the Information Plane; i.e., the plane of the Mutual
Information values that each layer preserves on the input and output variables. They suggested that
the goal of the network is to optimize the Information Bottleneck (IB) tradeoff between compression and prediction, successively, for each layer.
In this work we follow up on this idea and demonstrate the effectiveness of the InformationPlane visualization of DNNs. Our main results are: (i) most of the training epochs in standard
DL are spent on compression of the input to efficient representation and not on fitting the training
labels. (ii) The representation compression phase begins when the training errors becomes small
and the Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) epochs change from a fast drift to smaller training error
into a stochastic relaxation, or random diffusion, constrained by the training error value. (iii) The
converged layers lie on or very close to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theoretical bound, and the
maps from the input to any hidden layer and from this hidden layer to the output satisfy the IB
self-consistent equations. This generalization through noise mechanism is unique to Deep Neural
Networks and absent in one layer networks. (iv) The training time is dramatically reduced when
adding more hidden layers. Thus the main advantage of the hidden layers is computational. This
can be explained by the reduced relaxation time, as this it scales super-linearly (exponentially for
simple diffusion) with the information compression from the previous layer. (v) As we expect
critical slowing down of the stochastic relaxation near phase transitions on the IB curve, we expect
the hidden layers to converge to such critical points</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Deep Learning and the Information Bottleneck Principle</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>— Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are analyzed via
the theoretical framework of the information bottleneck (IB)
principle. We first show that any DNN can be quantified by
the mutual information between the layers and the input and
output variables. Using this representation we can calculate
the optimal information theoretic limits of the DNN and
obtain finite sample generalization bounds. The advantage of
getting closer to the theoretical limit is quantifiable both by
the generalization bound and by the network’s simplicity. We
argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and
features/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation
points of the information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant
compression of the input layer with respect to the output
layer. The hierarchical representations at the layered network
naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along
the information curve. We believe that this new insight can lead
to new optimality bounds and deep learning algorithms.</p>
