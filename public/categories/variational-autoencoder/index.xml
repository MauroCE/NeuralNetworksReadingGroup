      <description>On Wednesday \(28^{\text{th}}\) of October Mauro presented Adversarial Variational Bayes by Mescheder et al. You can find the slides for the presentation here. The abstract is given below:
 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are expressive latent variable models that can be used to learn complex probability distributions from training data. However, the quality of the resulting model crucially relies on the expressiveness of the inference model. We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB), a technique for training Variational Autoencoders with arbitrarily expressive inference models.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(28^{\text{th}}\) of July, Mauro presented Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows by Rezende and Mohamed. Two good review papers are Normalizing Flows for Probabilistic Modeling and Inference, which is more Tutorial in nature, and Normalizing Flows: An Introduction and Review of Current Methods, which is a bit more technical. Slides for the talk are available here.
The abstract is given below:
 The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems in variational inference.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(14^{\text{th}}\) of July, Mingxuan presented Neural Processes and Conditional Neural Processes by Marta Garnelo et al. You can find the notes here.
Abstract for Neural Processes:
 A neural network (NN) is a parameterised function that can be tuned via gradient descent to approximate a labelled collection of data with high precision. A Gaussian process (GP), on the other hand, is a probabilistic model that defines a distribution over possible functions, and is updated in light of data via the rules of probabilistic inference.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(7^{\text{th}}\) of July, Mauro Camara Escudero presented Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes. Slides can be found here. The abstract is given below.
 How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 26th of May Pierre Aurelien Gilliot presented Preventing Posterior Collapse with delta-VAEs. The main reference paper was the original VAE paper. The abstract is given below.
 Due to the phenomenon of “posterior collapse,” current latent variable generative models pose a challenging design choice that either weakens the capacity of the decoder or requires augmenting the objective so it does not only maximize the likelihood of the data.</description>
