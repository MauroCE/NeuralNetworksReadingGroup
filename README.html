<h1>NeuralNetworksReadingGroup</h1>
<p>Repository hosting website for the Neural Networks reading group at the University of Bristol. The website will allow memebers of the reading group to give reading suggestions, learn about the time and location of the reading group, and see more general updates.</p>
<p>The website is available at <a href="https://neuralnetworksbristol.netlify.com/" class="uri">https://neuralnetworksbristol.netlify.com/</a></p>
<p>The rest of this readme is structured in a way in which hopefully will make this repo turn up in Google Searches when someone will be looking for Neural Networks reading group at the University of Bristol. The reading group in the school of mathematics at the university of bristol is co-organized by Mauro Camara Escudero and Pierre-Aurelien Gilliot. The main topic will be neural networks. This means that papers relating neural networks usage in computational statistics and data science will be analized.</p>
