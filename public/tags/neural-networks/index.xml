      <description>On Tuesday \(14^{\text{th}}\) of July, Mingxuan presented Neural Processes and Conditional Neural Processes by Marta Garnelo et al.
Abstract for Neural Processes:
 A neural network (NN) is a parameterised function that can be tuned via gradient descent to approximate a labelled collection of data with high precision. A Gaussian process (GP), on the other hand, is a probabilistic model that defines a distribution over possible functions, and is updated in light of data via the rules of probabilistic inference.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(7^{\text{th}}\) of July, Mauro Camara Escudero presented Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes. Slides can be found here. The abstract is given below.
 How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(30^{\text{th}}\) of June Mark Beaumont presented Mining gold from implicit models to improve likelihood-free inference by Johann Brehmer et al. The abstract is given below:
 Simulators often provide the best description of real-world phenomena. However, the probability density that they implicitly define is often intractable, leading to challenging inverse problems for inference. Recently, a number of techniques have been introduced in which a surrogate for the intractable density is learned, including normalizing flows and density ratio estimators.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday \(14^{\text{th}}\) of April I presented Expectation Backpropagation:Parameter-Free Training of Multilayer Neural Networks with Continuous or Discrete Weights. The abstract is given below.
 Multilayer Neural Networks (MNNs) are commonly trained using gradient descent-based methods, such as BackPropagation (BP). Inference in probabilistic graphical models is often done using variational Bayes methods, such as Expectation Propagation (EP). We show how an EP based approach can also be used to train deterministic MNNs.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 10\(^{\text{th}}\) of March Patrick Rubin-Delanchy presented the 2019 NeurIPS paper winner of the Outstanding New Directions Paper Award, titled “Uniform convergence may be unable to explain generalization in deep learning” by Vaishnavh Nagarajan and J. Zico Kolter.
The abstract is given below.
 Aimed at explaining the surprisingly good generalization behavior of overparameterized deep networks, recent works have developed a variety of generalization bounds for deep learning, all based on the fundamental learning-theoretic technique of uniform convergence.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! I hope you are as excited as we are about the Neural Network reading group. We thought we’d make it more engaging by having a simple website where we can share links to the papers, post summaries and ideas. This is still a work in progress and feeback and suggestions are very much appreciated. For now, you can send your feedback to m.camaraescudero@bristol.ac.uk or to ys18223@bristol.ac.uk.</description>
